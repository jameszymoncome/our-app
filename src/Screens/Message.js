        Happy Anniversary, lovey! You probably didn't expect we'd be able to go this far, but I do. As you have said, it's not because you don't trust me; it's your attitude that you're afraid of if I can handle it, but guess what? I can handle it! As days go by, as our relationship progresses, I'm still trying to figure out how to put a smile on your face even though you're mad. I want to know you more; I want to know you best. I want to be the person you'll seek when the world is too much for you. I just want you to feel that there will always be a person that is willing to be there for you, always, regardless of the circumstances. 
      </p>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        The day I met you was not the best day of my life; it was the beginning of the best days of my life. I really am happy to meet such a wonderful person. A person who makes me want to do more and achieve so much more in life. With you I am the happiest; with you I can be the strongest version of myself. You give me strength, you give me love, and you give me everything I never knew I'd get from anyone. I love you so much, lovey! Cheers to our endless love!
      </p>
